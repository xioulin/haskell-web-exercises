    2. Which national parks are the best?
    We think that every national park is worth visiting. However, there are some national parks that are particularly
    unique in the world due to their geography. To get the best national park experience, we recommend visiting the
    Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone, Rocky Mountain, Zion, and Arches National Parks in the Western United States.
    Within the Eastern United States, the most famous national parks are Acadia, Great Smoky Mountains, and Everglades.

    3. Which national parks have the most visitors?
    Popular national parks with the most overnight visitors are Grand Canyon, Yosemite & Yellowstone. However, several
    national parks have are more popular for day visitors, making them feel more private and secluded from sundown to
    sunrise. For national parks with a higher amount of overnight visitors, we recommend making lodging and camping
    reservations in advance.

    4. Which national parks have the most wildlife?
    All national parks have wildlife from snakes and birds to larger animals such as wolves, bears, moose and buffalo
    and even marine life. To see the most wildlife we always recommend national parks that cover large forest areas such
    as Theodore Roosevelt National Park, Isle Royale, Rocky Mountain or Alaska’s Denali National Park. Yellowstone
    National Park in Wyoming is often referred to as the “Serengeti of America” because of its abundant variety of
    wildlife.

    5. Do national parks have guided tours?
    Yes, each national park offers guided tours that can either be hosted by the National Park Service (NPS) or by
    certified guides. A large part of the National Park Service mission aims to educate visitors about the uniqueness of
    each different park and how to enjoy each park to its fullest. Find information about guided tours at official park
    visitor and welcome centers or research for certified guides in gateway towns.

    6. How many people visit national parks each year?
    Last year, there were 327 million national park visits in the United States. Some national parks, like Zion, can
    become overcrowded during warmer months and require visitors to use park transportation rather than personal
    vehicles. Therefore, we recommend visiting during off-season months.

    7. Are there general rules when visiting a national park or does each park have specific ones?
    Yes, there are general rules when visiting national parks and you will find this information on the official
    national park website. In addition, each national park has specific rules that can change seasonally. For example,
    campfire regulations may fluctuate depending on drought conditions and the risk of wildfires.

    8. Where can I find official park maps?
    We think the best way to utilize a complete map of all national parks on a map is to use the Find Your Park tool
    provided by the National Park Service website. Many national parks have digital, downloadable versions of park maps
    as well hard copies in visitor and welcome centers.

    9. How do I make reservations for camping or staying in national parks?
    Most of the campsites in national parks and national forests are available on a first-come, first serve basis, but
    we still recommend travelers make reservations online whenever possible. We highly recommend making online
    reservations for popular national parks at least three to five months in advance.

    10. Can I drive into a national park and is there an entrance fee?
    Most of the national parks in the United States are accessible by car, RV or bus. When you enter the park, you’ll
    need to pay an entrance fee, which is usually between $20-$40 per vehicle. Park passes can be valid for up to seven
    days depending on the park and season. If you plan to visit several national parks, we recommend you buy the America
    the Beautiful Pass for $80.
